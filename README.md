# Vynapse

> A Rust-native deep learning and neuroevolution engine built as a hybrid learning runtime ‚Äî unifying the optimization paradigms of PyTorch, TensorFlow, DEAP, and NEAT into one modular, high-performance system.

---

## üöÄ Project Description

Vynapse is a multi-paradigm machine learning engine written entirely in safe Rust. It bridges **gradient-based learning** and **evolutionary optimization** within a unified execution and graph infrastructure. Inspired by the flexibility of PyTorch, the structural clarity of TensorFlow, and the adaptive search power of DEAP and NEAT, Vynapse supports:

- **SGD-style training with reverse-mode autodiff**
- **Topology-evolving neural networks using NEAT**
- **Population-based weight evolution in DEAP style**
- **Static graph execution with forward/backward scheduling**

Every training mode operates on the same core tensor and graph runtime, enabling flexible, hybrid workflows that can evolve, fine-tune, and deploy networks interchangeably.

---

## üß† What Makes Vynapse Different?

- **Hybrid Optimization**: Combine evolution and gradient descent in a single training loop (Lamarckian or Baldwinian modes).
- **Neuroevolution-Native**: Evolve both weights and graph structures with speciation, compatibility distance, and reproduction strategies.
- **Autodiff Engine**: Full reverse-mode autodiff with support for eager and static graph execution.
- **Rust Performance**: Built from the ground up in safe, parallel Rust ‚Äî no Python bindings, no unsafe blocks.
- **Runtime Unification**: A single graph engine powers static, dynamic, differentiable, and evolutionary workflows.

## üéØ Immediate Plans

### Population Management & Generation Loop (Generic Evolutionary Engine MVP)

- [ ] **Create Modular Training Infrastructure Foundation** - Build `training_setup/` module with focused infrastructure components: `FitnessStats` for performance tracking, `EvolutionConfig` for training parameters, `TrainingStats` for iteration management, `Population<G>` for genome storage and lifecycle, and `GeneticOperators<M, C>` for reproduction pipeline encapsulation
- [ ] **Implement Population Management Component** - Create `Population<G>` struct with genome storage (`Vec<G>`), size management, template-based initialization using mutation for diversity, population replacement strategies, and validation methods ensuring population consistency and proper memory allocation
- [ ] **Build Genetic Operations Manager** - Design `GeneticOperators<M, C>` component encapsulating mutation/crossover operators with their rates, reproduction pipeline orchestration, offspring generation with configurable probabilities, and input validation for genetic operator parameters
- [ ] **Create Training Statistics and Configuration System** - Implement `TrainingStats` with iteration tracking and convergence detection, `FitnessStats` with best/average/worst fitness and history management, and `EvolutionConfig` with generation limits, convergence thresholds, and stagnation detection parameters
- [ ] **Design Simplified Evolutionary Trainer Architecture** - Create `EvolutionaryTrainer<G, F, S>` using composed infrastructure components, delegating population management to `Population`, genetic operations to `GeneticOperators`, and statistics tracking to dedicated stats components, maintaining clean separation of concerns
- [ ] **Implement Sequential Fitness Evaluation Pipeline** - Build population-wide fitness assessment delegating to `Population` for genome access, implementing sequential evaluation with trait objects, fitness result collection in `FitnessStats`, and essential error handling for evaluation failures
- [ ] **Build Trait-Generic Selection and Reproduction System** - Implement parent selection using polymorphic `Selection` trait dispatch, offspring generation through `GeneticOperators` delegation, simple elitism preservation, and handling edge cases like identical fitness values
- [ ] **Create Generation Loop Orchestration** - Build main evolutionary coordinator with termination criteria using `EvolutionConfig`, progress tracking via `TrainingStats`, (Œº + Œª) population replacement through `Population` methods, and convergence detection with stagnation monitoring
- [ ] **Implement Generic Trainer Trait Integration** - Connect evolutionary trainer to unified training framework through standardized `Trainer` trait interface, enabling trait-based interchangeability with future SGD, NEAT, and other optimization implementations while maintaining modular architecture
- [ ] **Create MVP Integration Test Suite** - Build end-to-end validation testing complete modular pipeline instantiation (`FixedTopologyGenome + TaskBasedFitness + TournamentSelection`) with component isolation testing, architectural validation, basic convergence verification, and functional correctness validation

> **Goal**: Build a simple, fully generic, trait-based evolutionary optimization engine MVP using clean architectural separation. The system will demonstrate genuine evolutionary learning on the PowersOfTwo task while maintaining complete modularity through composed infrastructure components. This foundation serves as the core engine for future performance optimizations, parallelization, and advanced features across all 10 milestones.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Design Principles

These principles guide every architectural decision and milestone implementation:

### Trait-Based Modularity

Every component implements a trait interface, enabling complete interchangeability:

- **Genomes**: `FixedTopology`, `NEAT`, `VariableLength`, custom implementations
- **Fitness Functions**: `TaskBased`, `MultiObjective`, `Novelty`, custom evaluations
- **Selection Strategies**: `Tournament`, `Roulette`, `Rank`, custom selectors
- **Genetic Operators**: `Gaussian`, `Uniform`, `Polynomial` mutations; various crossovers
- **Loss Functions**: `MSE`, `CrossEntropy`, `MAE`, custom losses
- **Activations**: `Sigmoid`, `ReLU`, `Tanh`, custom functions

### Progressive Enhancement

Each milestone builds directly on previous work:

- Start with simple evolution on fixed topologies
- Add configuration before adding complexity
- Build gradient descent on top of existing tensor operations
- Merge paradigms only after individual mastery

### Configuration-First Design

Every feature is designed with JSON configurability in mind:

- No hard-coded hyperparameters
- String-based component selection
- Nested configuration objects
- Validation and defaults

## üéõÔ∏è Universal Configuration System

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**: Basic configuration arrives in Milestone 2, with features progressively added in each subsequent milestone.

### Philosophy: Complete Experimental Control

Vynapse uses a comprehensive JSON configuration system that provides complete control over every aspect of the training pipeline. The configuration grows with each milestone, starting simple and becoming more powerful as features are added.

### Configuration Evolution by Milestone

### Configuration Philosophy

The configuration system embodies Vynapse's core philosophy:

1. **Composability**: Mix and match any components that implement the same trait
2. **Experimentation**: Change any aspect without recompiling
3. **Reproducibility**: Complete experiment definition in one file
4. **Extensibility**: Add new components without changing the configuration schema
5. **Validation**: Fail fast with clear error messages
