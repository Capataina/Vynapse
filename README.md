# Vynapse

> A Rust-native deep learning and neuroevolution engine built as a hybrid learning runtime — unifying the optimization paradigms of PyTorch, TensorFlow, DEAP, and NEAT into one modular, high-performance system.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

Vynapse is a multi-paradigm machine learning engine written entirely in safe Rust. It bridges **gradient-based learning** and **evolutionary optimization** within a unified execution and graph infrastructure. Inspired by the flexibility of PyTorch, the structural clarity of TensorFlow, and the adaptive search power of DEAP and NEAT, Vynapse supports:

- **SGD-style training with reverse-mode autodiff**
- **Topology-evolving neural networks using NEAT**
- **Population-based weight evolution in DEAP style**
- **Static graph execution with forward/backward scheduling**

Every training mode operates on the same core tensor and graph runtime, enabling flexible, hybrid workflows that can evolve, fine-tune, and deploy networks interchangeably.

---

## 🧠 What Makes Vynapse Different?

- **Hybrid Optimization**: Combine evolution and gradient descent in a single training loop (Lamarckian or Baldwinian modes).
- **Neuroevolution-Native**: Evolve both weights and graph structures with speciation, compatibility distance, and reproduction strategies.
- **Autodiff Engine**: Full reverse-mode autodiff with support for eager and static graph execution.
- **Rust Performance**: Built from the ground up in safe, parallel Rust — no Python bindings, no unsafe blocks.
- **Runtime Unification**: A single graph engine powers static, dynamic, differentiable, and evolutionary workflows.

## 🎯 Immediate Plans

### Core Architecture Refactoring (Modular Task/Loss/Activation System)

- [x] **Create Task Trait** - Define a generic `Task` trait that specifies dataset generation, input/output dimensions, and task identification for all learning problems
- [x] **Move XOR to Task Implementation** - Refactor existing XOR logic from fitness function into a dedicated `XorTask` struct implementing the Task trait
- [x] **Create Powers of Two Task** - Implement `PowersOfTwoTask` for the MVP learning problem (teaching genomes to predict powers of 2: 1→2, 2→4, 3→8, etc.)
- [x] **Create Loss Trait** - Define a generic `Loss` trait for pluggable loss function implementations with standardized calculate and naming methods
- [x] **Implement MSE Loss Function** - Create `MeanSquaredError` struct implementing the Loss trait for regression-style fitness evaluation
- [x] **Create Activation Trait** - Define a generic `Activation` trait for pluggable activation functions with single-value and tensor-wide application methods
- [x] **Implement Sigmoid Activation** - Create dedicated `Sigmoid` struct implementing the Activation trait with proper mathematical implementation
- [ ] **Remove Sigmoid from Tensor Module** - Clean up tensor module by removing activation-specific logic, maintaining separation of concerns
- [ ] **Create Generalized Fitness Function** - Build `TaskBasedFitness<T, L, A>` struct that combines any Task, Loss, and Activation via generics
- [ ] **Implement Fitness Evaluation Logic** - Complete the modular fitness evaluation pipeline that runs datasets through networks with configurable components

> **Goal**: Transform the current tightly-coupled XOR fitness function into a flexible, "plug-and-play" system where tasks, loss functions, and activations can be mixed and matched without code changes.
